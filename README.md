# Reactive Nutshell

## Our team recreated our nutshell project using React, and bootstrap. We had 4 days to work on this project and focused mainly on Tasks, Messages, Events, and News and their CRUD functionality. Our app uses authenication meaning a user must be logged in/ create an account to view the content in the application.
